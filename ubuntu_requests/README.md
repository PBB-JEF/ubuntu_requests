# 🌍 Ubuntu-Inspired Image Fetcher

> _"I am because we are."_ — Ubuntu Philosophy

This project is a Python-based tool that respectfully connects to the global web community to fetch and organize shared images. Inspired by the Ubuntu principles of **community**, **respect**, **sharing**, and **practicality**, this script allows users to mindfully collect images from the internet and store them locally for appreciation and reuse.

---

## 🧠 Project Purpose

The Ubuntu Image Fetcher is designed to:
- Strengthen digital connection through shared resources
- Handle errors gracefully, respecting the unpredictability of the web
- Organize images for later sharing and community enrichment
- Serve as a practical tool for ethical image collection

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Accepts one or multiple image URLs
- ✅ Creates a `Fetched_Images/` directory automatically
- ✅ Downloads and saves images in binary mode
- ✅ Extracts filenames from URLs or generates defaults
- ✅ Checks for valid image content via HTTP headers
- ✅ Prevents duplicate downloads using hash comparison
- ✅ Handles network and runtime errors respectfully
